# Conservation Strategy Game — Replication-Ready Simulator

This repository contains a Monte Carlo simulator of contested conservation strategies (“Greens” vs “Farmers”), producing overlay figures (static + dynamic) and an effects table (PSE/DLE). The simulator replicates the results of the paper:

> Weinhold, D. & Andersen, L. E. (2025).  
> *Conservation Strategies in Contested Environments: Dynamic Monte Carlo Simulations and a Bolivian Case Study.*  
> London School of Economics & Universidad Privada Boliviana. Working Paper.  
> DOI: _TBA (after Zenodo release)_
